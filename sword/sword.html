        <span> <br/><br/>The sword appears as an object with a powerful power to designate its owner by separating it from a deeply embedded rock. The British legend Caliburn, who was not chosen by anyone, was unintentionally selected by Arthur to announce the appearance of the hero. The sword stuck in the stone has absolute power in the front of the story and provides a strong connection to the relationship of the characters, but is not noticed as an actor. 

          <br><br>Park Ji-ho focuses on the non-visible narratives of omniscient objects that govern the fate of the main character in the exhibition “Sword, stone, and hero”. He separates Caliban and stone, which used to function only as symbols, from existing narratives, and drives a narrative based on the materiality of objects in augmented reality. Noting the moment when things have the bizarre power to ignite themselves, like any sculpture, the artist took knives and stones to an independent dimension from literary narratives and recreated the conditions under which they were placed. Knife and stone interact with the audience at a diversified online contact point during the exhibition period, acquiring new material properties and embodying the narrative between elements.<br><br>
           Park Ji-ho's online exhibition  “Sword, Stone, Hero”, which will be held to mark the opening of the "Love Your Depot" Gangnam Pavilion in 2021, is an online augmented reality exhibition based on the actions and power of knives and stones that gave birth to hero narratives in King Arthur's story. The artist distributes Augmented Reality (AR) data so that viewers can enjoy the three objects ‘Caledfwlch’, ‘Caliburnus’, and ‘Collbrande’ in their daily space through personal mobile phones, and displays the video ‘Draw Your Word’ through online screening so that they can enjoy it in a special web structure. A viewer may view an object implemented as graphic data in 3D and share a photo or video taken thereof on SNS. During the three-week exhibition period, the artist continuously responds to the posts generated by the viewers, and scraps the participants' links and rearranges them on the web page where the video is screened. Data shared by viewers by clicking, dragging, zooming in, capturing, and recording works through AR appears to wander over the artist's video, making the viewing environment constantly different. <br><br> The virtual space where objects appear in “Knife, Stone, Hero” interpreted and applied Gangnam Pavilion's bottom-spinning storage (Turndepot). In 2021, Love Your Depot Gangnam Pavilion will be unveiled for the first time on-site at Suseogung Village Park on November 11, following the opening of Park Ji-ho's “Sword, Stone, Hero" online on November 4.
